# PegasusGIM-V

# GIM-V stands for Generalized Iterative Matrix-Vector multiplication.

# Graph mining applications such as PageRank, spectral clustering, diameter estimation, connnected components etc. used repeated
  matrix-vector multiplication
  
# GIM-Vis highly optimized

# It achieves (a) good scale-up on thenumber  of  available  machines (b)  linear  running  time  on  thenumber of edges, and 
  (c) more than5 timesfaster performanceover  the non-optimized version 
  ofGIM-V
  
# web graphs can be downloaded from http://snap.stanford.edu/

# Parse the graph file to get the input file format

# Run that input file in Hadoop MapReduce jobs
